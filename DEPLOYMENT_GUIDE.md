# GitHub Pages Deployment Setup Instructions

## Current Status
✅ **All deployment issues have been fixed and code committed successfully!**

## What Was Fixed

### 1. GitHub Actions Workflow (`deploy.yml`)
- ✅ Updated to use `gh-pages` branch deployment approach
- ✅ Fixed permissions (`contents: write` instead of `read`)
- ✅ Removed environment protection conflicts
- ✅ Uses reliable `peaceiris/actions-gh-pages@v3` action
- ✅ Removed duplicate workflow files

### 2. Code Issues Fixed
- ✅ Fixed incomplete JSX code in `NewsPage3D.tsx`
- ✅ Removed duplicate tag rendering code
- ✅ All TypeScript/React syntax errors resolved
- ✅ Build process now completes successfully

### 3. Repository Configuration
- ✅ Updated `.gitignore` to exclude build artifacts
- ✅ All changes committed and pushed to main branch

## GitHub Repository Settings Required

To complete the deployment setup, please follow these steps in your GitHub repository:

### Step 1: Configure GitHub Pages
1. Go to your repository: `https://github.com/SiddhantSShende/RNR-WEB_DEMO`
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select:
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **gh-pages** (this will be created automatically by the action)
   - Folder: **/ (root)**
5. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Verify Workflow Permissions
1. In your repository, go to **Settings** → **Actions** → **General**
2. Under **Workflow permissions**, ensure:
   - ✅ **Read and write permissions** is selected
   - ✅ **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests** is checked
3. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Monitor Deployment
1. Go to **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You should see the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow running
3. Once it completes successfully, the `gh-pages` branch will be created
4. Your site will be available at: `https://siddhantsshende.github.io/RNR-WEB_DEMO/`

## Expected Workflow Process
1. **Trigger**: Push to `main` branch (✅ Done)
2. **Build**: GitHub Actions builds the project (✅ Ready)
3. **Deploy**: Creates/updates `gh-pages` branch with built files (✅ Ready)
4. **Serve**: GitHub Pages serves from `gh-pages` branch (⏳ Needs repository settings)

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

### Check Workflow Status
- Visit: `https://github.com/SiddhantSShende/RNR-WEB_DEMO/actions`
- Look for any failed workflow runs
- Check the logs for specific error messages

### Verify Branch Creation
- After successful workflow run, check if `gh-pages` branch exists
- It should contain the built files (`index.html`, `assets/` folder, etc.)

### Custom Domain (Optional)
If you want to use a custom domain:
1. Add a `CNAME` file to your repository root with your domain
2. Update the workflow to include the CNAME in deployment
3. Configure DNS settings with your domain provider
